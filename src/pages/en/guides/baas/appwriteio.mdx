[Appwrite.io](https://appwrite.io/) is a self-hosted backend-as-a-service platform that provides developers with all the core APIs required to build any application.

## Integrating with Astro

In this section, we'll use the [Appwrite.io JavaScript SDK](https://appwrite.io/docs/getting-started-for-web#getSDK) to connect your Appwrite.io project to Astro.

### Prerequisites

To get started, you will need to have the following:

1. **An Astro project** - If you don't have an Astro project yet, our [Installation guide](/en/install/auto/) will get you up and running in no time.

2. **An Appwrite.io instance, or hosted instance**. If you don't have an account, you can [sign up](https://cloud.appwrite.io/login) for a free account and create a new Appwrite.io project. You can also use an existing project if you have one. 

3. **Appwrite.io credentials** - You can find the following credentials in your Appwrite.io console **Project Overview > API key**. 

    - **Project ID** - The ID of your Project (not the name). 

### Setting up credentials

To add your Appwrite.io project's credentials to Astro, create an `.env` file in the root of your project with the following variables:

:::tip
You may find that you will need additional environment variables, feel free to continue adding to the `.env` file.
:::

```ini title=".env"
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=YOUR_ENDPOINT
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
APPWRITE_DB_ID=YOUR_DATABASE_ID
APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=YOUR_COLLECTION_ID
...
```

Now, you should be able to use these environment variables in your project. 

If you would like to have IntelliSense for your Contentful environment variables, you can create a `env.d.ts` file in the `src/` directory and configure `ImportMetaEnv` like this:

```ts title="src/env.d.ts"
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  readonly APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID: string;
  readonly APPWRITE_DB_ID: string;
  readonly APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID: string;
}
```
:::tip
Read more about [using environment variables](/en/guides/environment-variables/) and `.env` files in Astro.
:::

Your root directory should now include these new files:

<FileTree title="Project Structure">
- src/
  - **env.d.ts**
- **.env**
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
</FileTree>

### Installing dependencies

To connect with your Appwrite.io project, install both of the following using the single command below for your preferred package manager:
- [`appwrite`](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-web), the official Appwrite.io SDK for JavaScript.

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npm install appwrite
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm install appwrite
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn add appwrite
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Next, create a new file called `appwrite.ts` in `src/lib/` directory in your project.

```ts title="src/lib/appwrite.ts"
import { Client } from 'appwrite';

export const client = new Client()
    .setEndpoint(import.meta.env.APPWRITE_ENDPOINT) // Your API Endpoint
    .setProject(import.meta.env.APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID); // Your project ID

```

The above code snippet creates a new Appwrite.io client, passing in credentials from the `.env` file. 

Finally, your root directory should now include these new files:

<FileTree title="Project Structure">
- src/
  - env.d.ts
  - lib/
    - **appwrite.ts**
- .env
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
</FileTree>

### Fetching data

:::caution
Please note that you can use the same SDK to access both the serverside and clientside data. So you must be careful anytime you are setting up your client and how you instantiate the client to use an Admin type of API. If you are just on the clientside all of the security will be set accordingly based on the user making the call to the backend.

A good example of this is if you are building static pages, you will want to use an API key. When interactively using Appwrite in React you won't need to add the API Key.
